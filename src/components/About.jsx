  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a passionate researcher working at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. 
    My work focuses on EEG signal processing, multimodal brainâ€“computer interfaces, and the 
    application of advanced deep learning architectures for healthcare. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am particularly motivated by building interpretable and biologically inspired AI systems 
    that can contribute to early diagnosis of neurological and cognitive disorders. 
    Beyond technical expertise, I value collaboration, innovation, and scientific rigor.
